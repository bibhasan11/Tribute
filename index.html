                  Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American businessman, inventor, and investor best known for co-founding 
                  the technology giant Apple Inc.Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended 
                  Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment 
                  before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I">Apple I</a> personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the
                   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the 
                   Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development
                    of the unsuccessful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa">Apple Lisa</a> in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the
                     first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript.
